        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p class="lead"><em>Erik's Pony Checkup</em> is an automated security checkup for <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>
            websites. There are several security practices that can easily be probed from the outside, and this is what
            Erik's pony checkup looks for.</p>
        <p>Knowing what's wrong is only the first step:
            Erik's Pony Checkup helps by explaining not just the risks, but also how to best fix an issue.</p>
        <p>This is by no means a perfect system. <em>This is not a replacement for a full security audit.</em> But it is a
            simple and fast way of seeing the basic pressing issues. Do note that there are many vulnerabilities which
            can not be detected in this way, like SQL or XSS injection.</p>

        <h2>Why did you build this?</h2>
        <p class="lead">To help <a href="http://www.erik.io/blog/2013/12/15/appeal-for-security-for-the-ordinary-developer/">the ordinary developer</a>
            with securing their Django projects.
            In June 2012, I spoke at <a href="http://2012.djangocon.eu">Djangocon EU</a>
            about Building secure Django websites
            (<a href="http://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/index.php?talkID=7">video</a>/<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/erik/p/building-secure-django-websites">slides</a>)
            which met with great response. I was inspired to build this tool by Jessica McKellar's
            <a href="http://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/index.php?talkID=35">keynote</a>, in which
            she explained how hard all this can be for people new to Django.</p>
        <p>In addition, many experienced Django developers approached me after my talk to admit that they had made
            some of the errors I mentioned. Someone even made a serious error on stage the next day. This, combined with the fact
            that quite a few things can easily be checked remotely with a few HTTP requests, inspired me to build this.</p>
